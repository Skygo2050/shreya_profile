            <p class="clothes">I really enjoy wearing Indian traditional clothing and baggy, comfortable clothes. They have such a unique and elegant style. Traditional Indian outfits like sarees, kurtas, and pajamas are not only beautiful but also very comfortable to wear. Baggy clothes - I absolutely love wearing baggy clothes! They are so comfy and give such a relaxed and laid-back vibe. Baggy pants, oversized shirts, and flowy dresses are some of my favorites. They allow for freedom of movement and make me feel at ease throughout the day. It's always fun to express through clothing.</p>
